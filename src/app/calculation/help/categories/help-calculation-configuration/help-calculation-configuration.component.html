      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>The Calculation Builder produces the relevant steps to build a calculation this will consist of the inputs
        used in the calculation, the configuration of the steps and the functions to build the calculation. Then the
        outputs that will be made available from the calculation after this has been run.

      <h3>
        Building Calculation
      </h3>
      <p>
        The configuration is done row by row; the calculation is built up by using a combination of functions which
        need to
        correspond with each other to build up the calculation. Principally the way this is executed in the application
        is
        to create rows of a specific data type which can then be referenced at various points in the configuration
        to
        utilise those values within the functions and reuse the values.
        In order to do this the user can create inputs in the Calculation Inputs, to define these variables within the
        Calculation Configuration which can then be used e.g. DOB (Date of
        Birth). The Calculation Configuration then takes these inputs and manipulates them to produce some new values,
        which then pass into the Calculation Output. The Calculation Output selects various Calculation Configuration
        values and uses them to output a list of values.
      </p>

      <h3>
        Using Chips
      </h3>
      <p>
        On each function in the Calculation Configuration builder the user will able to drag a set of chips which
        should be previously set values for example Date of Birth to use within that function to manipulate this.
        Say for instance weâ€™ve created two input fields for
        Date of Birth and Date of Marriage in the Input category; these can be amended for each calculation that is run
        with a value that the user can add in.
        For a particular function we require to find the date duration between these two dates, so the user will create
        a new function run for
        Date Duration. The function requires two date field to be added in, the user can either add in a date value in
        here by typing this in, alternatively, the user can reference the previously set value for Date of Birth/Date
        of Marriage as a
        Chip within the function which can be dragged into the input fields for use. The calculation will then replace
        the value of Date of Birth/Date of Marriage with the date value that has been assigned to it.

        In the Maths and IfLogic Functions the chip can be double clicked to add to the end of the formula.

      <br />
      <p>
        Each function creates an output; the accumulation of all of these outputs creates the calculation in full. A
        reasonable variable name should be used in all cases in order to reference any changes in the future. Variables
        names can be reused and overwritten within the calculation later on bare this in mind when configuring the
        calculations.
