  <mat-tab label="If Logic">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      The If Logic function allows the user to create a formula to determine if a logic is true or false this logical
      check will provide a true or false response dependant on the formula that has been passed through.
      This true or false value can then be used on the top of each function in the If Logic input field to determine
      when to use the function.

    <br />
    <img class=".header-image" src="../../../../../assets/images/help/functions/If-Logic.JPG" class="center">
    <br />
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Builder Functions</h3>
    <p>
      An if logic function can only be used on one data type that is passed through so it can only do a logic on for
      example two Number fields or two Date fields, this is to ensure that the user is comparing to fields in the same
      data type.
      So the function requires the user to input the data type that will be used in the drop down field.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the user has selected the relevant data type, the function will present with a list of chips with the other
      values based on that data type that are output from the calculation, these
      chips can be dragged into the formula field when displayed for use within the function, these will then use the
      relevant data fields values stored against these which have been calculated previously.
      If you do not need to use a previously set value there will be an input field to add the relevant data type to
      the formula and want to add in a the relevant value that is required.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the formula field the user can move around the various inputs within the formula to reposition them where
      required, this also works when adding in a chip to the field. If the user is adding in a value that is not a chip
      this will be added to the end.
    </p>

    <h3>Function Descriptions</h3>
    <h3>Operators</h3>
    <p>
      In order to build the formula the function requires various operators in order to determine if the if logic
      condition is correct, please see below a list of available operators and their function, please note these should
      be used within the formula in the correct place, in the event that they are not in the correct place the
      calculation will output false.

    <ul>
      <li>
        == - Equal

  <mat-tab label="Lookup Table">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This function enables the calculation to lookup a table from Lookup Maintenance to return a value like the
      VLOOKUP function in Excel. The Lookup Maintenance function builds the table and stores it against your user
      profile. The table can then be used in this function by selecting the table required.
    </p>
    <br />
    <img class=".header-image" src="../../../../../assets/images/help/functions/Lookup-Table.JPG" class="center">
    <br />
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Builder Functions</h3>
    <p>
      An if Lookup Table function can only be used on one data type that is passed through so it can do a lookup on for
      example a Number fields or a Date field, this is to ensure that the function can find the correct value based on
      the data type.
      So the function requires the user to input the Lookup Data Type that will be used in the drop down field.
    </p>
    <p>
      After the user has selected the relevant data type, the function will present with a list of chips with the other
      values based on that data type that are output from the calculation, these
      chips can be dragged into the Lookup Value field when displayed for use within the function, these will then use
      the
      relevant data fields values stored against these which have been calculated previously.
      If you do not need to use a previously set value there will be an input field to add the relevant data type to
      the Lookup Value and want to add in a the relevant value that is required.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Function Descriptions</h3>
    <h3>Table Name</h3>
    <p>
      The name of the available Lookup Table names in Lookup Maintentence, see the Lookup Table Maintenance section to
      find a
      list of available factor tables to use.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Lookup Data Type</h3>
    <p>
      This will be the data type required to do the lookup, this needs to be set to ensure that the function can find
      the relevant lookup value.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Lookup Value</h3>
    <p>
      This is the value that the function will use to lookup the table in lookup maintenance. This will always lookup
      the first column in the table to find the value.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Columns</h3>
    <p>
      This is the column to return from the lookup table, this will be a list of the column names on the Lookup
      Maintenance Table, please select the column where the value you with to return is held.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Output Data Type</h3>
    <p>
      This is the output data type to define the return data type from the factor table which can then be used in other
      functions. So the user may look up a date in the first column but will return a number against that the number
      can then be used as that data type else where within the calculation.

  <!-- <mat-tab label="String Functions">
    <h3>Overview</h3>
    <p>
      This function is used to manipulate or analyse a string value. This function accepts hard coded strings or
      variables that have been used. There is no validation applied on the string field as the string should be open to
      be manipulated in the event that a hard coded string is being used, although if a variable is set previous with
      that string value it will take that variable value rather than using the string.
