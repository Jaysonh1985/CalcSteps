  <h3>Overview</h3>
  <p>
    A regression facility is associated with every calculation; this is to be used to store calculation results at a
    specific point in time. The idea is that if any adjustment is made in the future to the configuration, then the
    outputs remain the same or donâ€™t change to protect the members used in test.
    The way to use this is to add one member to regression at a time rather than multiple members, so build the
    configuration for the first member then when the expected results match for the test member in test the test
    member should be added to regression. The next member should be picked up and configured in the builder before
    adding into regression and testing against the previous member(s) to ensure that they still match.

  <h3>Adding Member to Regression</h3>
  <p>
    Once the configuration has been built in the builder and the expected results match, this configuration must be
    saved in order to access the Regression facility. Access Regression by clicking the Regression button.
  </p>
  <p>
    To add a new saved calculation in click the Add button, insert a reference number for the member and if a comment
    is required this can be used for defining the scenario for this member.
    Then click the cog to add in the Inputs for the regression, this will then create all the inputs available in the
    builder. Click the Use Current Inputs button to take the inputs from the current builder and click save.

  <h3>Running Regression</h3>
  <p>
    Once the member has been added with the inputs, click Run All this will then create an baseline value in the old
    column and will display a button to view this output. If you click the old button this will display all of the
    outputs from the baseline run in the outputs screen. You can also search the outputs for specific outputs.

  <h3>Encountering a Fail in Regression</h3>
  <p>
    If a change has been made to the configuration and this creates a difference against the previous result in the
    regression for the member, this will then create a new output in the new column which can be clicked and
    displayed to the user. The Pass/Fail will then be displayed as red and this must be investigated. The user will
    be displayed with the differences which will be contained in the Differences column, click this button and it
    will show the differences between the old result and the new result.
    The user will then have to decide whether the new results are correct or not. If the results are not correct then
    click Reject All; this will keep the Old results. If the results are correct and these are now the baseline
    regression results select Accept All this will replace the Old results with the New and set the Pass/Fail to
    green.
    To investigate these results click the two opposing arrows on the row to investigate, this should populate the
    builder with these inputs for quick debugging.
