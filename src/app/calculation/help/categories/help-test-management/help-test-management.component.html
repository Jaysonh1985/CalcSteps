      A Test Management function is associated with every calculation; this is to be used to store calculation results
      at a
      specific point in time for a particular set of inputs, to ensure that if any changes are made to the
      configuration then the previous tests are unaffected.

    <h3>Add Test</h3>
    <p>
      In order to create a test click the Add Test button this will create a blank new test to use.

    <h3>View Test</h3>
    <p>
      To view the test either a new or a previous test click the View Test button on the relevant test which will take
      the user into the Test Manager for that test.

    <h3>Running Test</h3>
    <p>
      Each test must be run individually, the user must enter each of the tests in their specific Test Manager and
      click the Calculate button on the footer row, this will then calculate whether the test has passed or failed with
      the new configuration of the calculation. If the tests have all passed after the changes you have made then that
      means you have not introduced any defects to the calculation so that this can be released.

      The following descriptions define what all of the input fields are for:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        Group - Add a Group name for the tests to allow the user to organise the tests into specific groups of tests
      </li>
      <li>
        Name - Allows the user to Name the tests
      </li>
      <li>
        Description - Allows the user to add additional details about the test as a description
      </li>
      <li>
        Pass - Displays to the user if the test is in a current Pass state, this should be used in conjunction with
        Last Update Date to see when the test was last run, if this has been before recent changes to the calculation
        have been made then please run the test again
      </li>
      <li>
        Owner - Displays to the user the owner of the calculation
      </li>
      <li>

      This screen will show the user the Calculation Inputs required for the specific test, these will be mapped from
      the current inputs
      in the calculation if there are new ones then these will be available in the list of inputs and will be blank as
      an input. The inputs are what drives the scenarios under test and each test in test manager will need their own
      specific inputs in order to perform the tests.

      This screen will show the user the Calculation Outputs that will be result from the calculation being run and
      that are required for the specific test. The user needs to complete the Expected Results field only the other
      fields will be readonly. The Expected Result is what is saved for the test so that the calculation can compare
      the output on that field against the expected result of that test in Test Manager.

    <h3>Output</h3>
    <p>
      Please complete the Expected Result field in here in order to ensure that the calculation checks the output
      against your expected result in order to test that this is working correctly.
    </p>
    <mat-divider></mat-divider>
    <h3>Pass/Fail</h3>
    <p>
      The calculation will assess each expected result in the Calculation Output against the Expected Results and will
      populate the Pass/Fail column with True for Pass and False for Fail. If the calculation has passed all expected
      results then the Test in Test Management will be set to Pass and however, if there is a Fail then the user must
      take the inputs back into the calculation configuration and find out why the test has failed.
