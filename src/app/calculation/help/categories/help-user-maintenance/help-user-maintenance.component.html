    <p>
      This feature enables the owner of the calculation to link other users to the specific calculation so that they
      can access this and run a calculation of their own using this one.
    </p>
    <p>
      If you have signed up to our Gold or Enterprise subscriptions then you can add other users who can access the
      calculation, if you are a Gold user then you can add up to 10 users or if you are Enterprise unlimited users who
      are signed up to Calc-Steps who can view the calculation.
