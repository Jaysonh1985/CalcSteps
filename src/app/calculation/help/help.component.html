        <h3>Help</h3>
        <p>
          This page is to assist the user with the Calc-Steps website. The Calc-Steps website allows a user to build a
          calculation of their requirements that can be used at any time online. The user builds their own calculations
          which with using Release/User Management can be shared with other users to use a Released version of the
          calculation that doesn't have any configuration available to edit. This Release is auditable and has the
          ability to be rolled back.
        </p>
        <p>
          Calc-Steps also allows the user to Test their own calculations and gives a Test-Management harness in order
          to manage any changes in the calculation to ensure that no defects are introduced.
